## Phase 1 – Datapath Foundations

### Fayez
- Designed and implemented the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Implemented:
  - ADD / SUB
  - AND / OR / NOT
  - Shift operations (SHL, SHR, SHRA)
  - Rotate operations (ROL, ROR)
  - NEG
- Verified ALU functionality using simulation
- Integrated ALU modules into top-level `alu.v`

### Yehia
- Designed and implemented:
  - Multiplication unit
  - Division unit
- Integrated MUL and DIV into the ALU structure

### Amit
- Designed and implemented:
  - Databus architecture
  - Register-to-bus connections
  - Core datapath wiring between modules
- Assisted in integrating registers and ALU into shared bus system
